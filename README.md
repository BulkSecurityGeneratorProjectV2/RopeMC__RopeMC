## Info
see how to install at the [Wiki](https://github.com/RopeMC/RopeMC/wiki) ! 

## Credits
Our current code includes code that is not written by us, but there is currently no way to include it into the building process without adding it to the repository. We'll change that later.
For now these are the credits for the used libraries:
Gson [com.google.gson] by Google (https://github.com/google/gson)
Javaassist [javaassist] by the Javaassist Team (http://jboss-javassist.github.io/javassist/)
